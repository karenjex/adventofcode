# Advent of Code (Attempted) Solutions

# adventofcode2024

I'm using Ruby this year. 
I've spoken at several Ruby conferences over the last couple of years, so I thought it was time I gave it a try!

Solutions to Advent of Code 2022

Scripts are in Python this year because I need to practice
* I am NOT a Python programmer, so please don't consider anything I do "best practice"
* My goal is to get a solution to each challenge, not to write beautiful code!
* That said, any day I have spare time, I will go back and create "improved" solutions and/or add useful comments to my scripts

There is a subfolder per day (named dd), containing:
* get_input.sh : shell script containing single command to download the day's input to input.txt
* input.txt : downloaded input
* input_test.txt : test input for debugging purposes
* solution_01.py : solution to the day's first challenge
* solution_02.py : solution to the day's second challenge
