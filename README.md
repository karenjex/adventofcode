Solutions to Advent of Code 2022

Scripts are in Python this year because I need to practice - I am NOT a Python programmer, so please don't consider anything I do "best practice"
My goal is very much to get a solution to each challenge, not to write beautiful code!
That said, any day I have spare time, I will go back and create "improved" solutions and/or add useful comments to my scripts

One subfolder per day, containing:
  get_input.sh : shell script containing single command to download the day's input to input.txt
  input.txt : downloaded input
  input_test.txt : test input for debugging purposes
  solution_01.py : solution to the day's first challenge
  solution_02.py : solution to the day's second challenge
